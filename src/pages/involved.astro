    <p>
      Thank you for your interest in contributing to the development of our
      application! Your help is essential to make it even better. Here's how you
      can participate and contribute to the project effectively:
    </p>

    <h2>Clone the Repository and Modify the Code</h2>

    <p>
      To get started, you need a local copy of our code repository. This will
      allow you to make changes and improvements to the application. Follow
      these steps:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Fork <a href="https://github.com/chrisvdev/obs-chat">the repository</a>
         to your own GitHub account.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="block">
          Clone your repository to your local machine using the following
          command:
        </span>
        <code>git clone https://github.com/chrisvdev/obs-chat</code>
      </li>
      <li>Make the modifications and improvements you wish in the code.</li>
      <li>
        Push your changes to your repository using <code>git commit</code> and <code
          >git push</code
        >.
      </li>
      <li>
        Finally, create a <a
          href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests">
          pull request
        </a> to suggest your changes to the main repository. Our team will
        review your contributions and incorporate them if they are appropriate.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Report Issues, Suggest Changes, or New Features</h2>

    <p>
      If you encounter bugs or have ideas to enhance the application, you can
      use the "Issues" section in our repository to communicate it. Follow these
      steps:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Go to the <a
          href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/managing-your-work-with-issues-and-projects/about-issues">
          Issues
        </a> section in our repository.
      </li>
      <li>Click "New Issue" to create a new "Issue".</li>
      <li>
        Describe the problem or your suggestion in detail. The more information
        you provide, the better we can understand and address the issue or
        evaluate the idea.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Recommend the Application to Friends or Use It Yourself</h2>

    <p>
      You can contribute not only technically but also by promoting the
      application. You can do this in the following ways:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Recommend the application to your friends, streamers, or contacts who
        may be interested in using it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use it yourself and share your experience. The more people who use it,
        the more feedback and potential improvements we can receive.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote class="border-l-2 border-l-gray-400 px-4 my-8 text-lg">
      Your contribution is valuable and appreciated! We are excited to work
      together to make our application an exceptional product. Thank you for
      being part of our development team!
