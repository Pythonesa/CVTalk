      1. Clone the Repository and Modify the Code:
    </h2>

    <p class="mx-4 mb-4 text-center">
      To get started, you need a local copy of our code repository. This will
      allow you to make changes and improvements to the application. Follow
      these steps:
    </p>

    <ol class="w-fit max-w-3xl mx-8">
      <li class="m-1">
        <strong>
          <a
            href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo"
            >Step 1:</a
          >
        </strong> Fork our repository to your own GitHub account.
      </li>
      <li class="m-1">
        <strong>Step 2:</strong> Clone your repository to your local machine
        using the <code>git clone https://github.com/chrisvdev/obs-chat</code>
         command.
      </li>
      <li class="m-1">
        <strong>Step 3:</strong> Make the modifications and improvements you
        wish in the code.
      </li>
      <li class="m-1">
        <strong>Step 4:</strong> Push your changes to your repository using <code
          >git commit</code
        > and <code>git push</code>.
      </li>
      <li class="m-1">
        <strong>Step 5:</strong> Finally, create a <a
          href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests"
          >pull request</a
        > to suggest your changes to the main repository. Our team will review
        your contributions and incorporate them if they are appropriate.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="font-bold text-2xl mt-8 mb-4 text-center">
      2. Report Issues, Suggest Changes, or New Features:
    </h2>

    <p class="mx-4 mb-8 text-center">
      If you encounter bugs or have ideas to enhance the application, you can
      use the "Issues" section in our repository to communicate it. Follow these
      steps:

    <ol class="max-w-3xl mx-8">
      <li class="m-1">
        Go to the <a
          href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/managing-your-work-with-issues-and-projects/about-issues"

        > section in our repository.
      </li>
      <li class="m-1">Click "New Issue" to create a new "Issue".</li>
      <li class="m-1">
        Describe the problem or your suggestion in detail. The more information
        you provide, the better we can understand and address the issue or
        evaluate the idea.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="font-bold text-2xl mt-8 mb-4 text-center">
      3. Recommend the Application to Friends or Use It Yourself:
