## How to Add Your Own Skin to the Application:

1.  Access the Template on CodePen Open your web browser and go to the demonstration  [template on CodePen](https://codepen.io/chrisvill2312/pen/vYvPrKK). Make sure you are viewing the template's editing interface.
2.  Modify the Template Style Edit the template's CSS to customize it with your own style. You can modify colors, fonts, sizes, and any other visual aspects according to your preferences. Ensure that the preview reflects your changes.
3.  Save Your Changes on CodePen Click the "Save" button at the top of the page to save your modifications on CodePen. Assign a unique name to your customized version of the template.
4.  Create a Repository on GitHub, Open GitHub (if you don't have an account, sign up for free). Log in to your GitHub account. In your GitHub dashboard, click the "New" button to create a new repository. Make sure the repository is public so that others can access it.
5. Add Your CSS to GitHub After creating the repository, you will find instructions for uploading files. Follow those instructions to upload the CSS file you modified on CodePen. Once you've uploaded the CSS file, confirm the upload.
6.  Get the URL of the CSS File on GitHub Go to the CSS file you uploaded in your repository. Click on the file to open it. At the top, you will find a button that says "Raw." Click on it to open the file in its raw format. Copy the URL from the browser's address bar. This URL will be what others use to access your CSS file.
7.  Use the Custom Skin in the Application Now that you have the URL of the CSS file on GitHub, you can use it in your application. The web assistant provides a field for users to enter the URL of their custom CSS file from GitHub. When you click "generate URL," it will include your skin in the configuration.

With these steps, users can customize the appearance of your application using their own CSS and sharing the link to their GitHub repository.
